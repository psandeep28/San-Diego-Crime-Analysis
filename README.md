# San-Diego-Crime-Analysis
Crime and policing ignite deep discussions and varied perspectives across the United States, touching on the complex interplay of governance, societal norms, and the roots of criminal behavior. One often-discussed aspect is the relationship between socioeconomic status and crime. Embarking on our exploration in the San Diego area, we ventured with the hypothesis that a tangible correlation exists between socioeconomic levels and crime rates. What unfolded was an enlightening journey into the intricacies of crime dynamics.

Our initial expectation was to uncover a straightforward dataset that encapsulated all necessary information, allowing us to draw clear conclusions through simple visualizations. However, the complexity of crime quickly became apparent. Factors such as education level, population density, policing strategies, and healthcare access emerged as significant influencers of crime rates, underscoring the multifaceted nature of this social issue. In recognition of these elements, we expanded our data collection efforts to include these variables, aiming to provide a more comprehensive analysis.

Equipped with a richer dataset, we delved into Exploratory Data Analysis with renewed vigor. Our investigation was exhaustive, examining an array of visualizations to uncover patterns and insights. This included analyzing the relationship between total crime rates and income levels, as well as dissecting crime categories within various income brackets. This approach allowed us to navigate the nuanced landscape of crime in the San Diego area, providing a more nuanced understanding of its correlation with socioeconomic status. 

Our statistical analysis unveiled significant differences in crime rates across various income brackets in the San Diego area, with an F-statistic of 3.4697 and a p-value of 0.0194 underscoring these disparities. Notably, the medium income bracket experienced the highest crime rate, challenging conventional expectations and highlighting the complexity of socioeconomic influences on crime. Despite a weak to moderate negative correlation between median income and crime rate, the influence of confounding variables like schools, libraries, and healthcare facilities on crime was statistically insignificant. This suggests a nuanced interplay between income levels and crime rates, emphasizing the need for a multifaceted approach to understanding and addressing the dynamics of crime in relation to socioeconomic factors.

Our journey revealed that crime is far from a monolithic entity, influenced by a tapestry of societal factors. The initial hypothesis, while straightforward, opened the door to a deeper exploration of the conditions under which crime flourishes and the myriad ways in which it intersects with socioeconomic levels. This exploration was not only a testament to the complexity of crime but also a compelling reminder of the importance of considering a wide range of factors when analyzing social phenomena.
